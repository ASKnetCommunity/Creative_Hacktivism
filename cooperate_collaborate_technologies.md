## What is a Hacker and what does a Hacker do?

_Hacking is finding and building your own path, your own way to deal with digital worlds._

  <em>What is a Hacker?</em></p>

* **Unpeel layers:** Explore what lies beneath the smooth surface of technologies (try Ctrl-U on a webpage in your browser if you're using Windows or Linux, or Command-U on OSX).
* **Notice details:** Pay attention to details; for instance, details in a sender's email address can help you identify if it's a spam mail.
* **Use an oblique gaze:** Observe your behavior when you are in a relationship with the machine.
* **Share and collaborate:** Fostering the creation of new knowledge is essential; share what you notice or discover.

## Technologies of Domination

_We love using digital tools; each tool grants us unique abilities, but the way we use these powers is not always within our control._

### Is it really up to you? 

Zoom, Telegram, Facebook, YouTube, Tiktok… Each platform is designed in a certain way…

* Reproduces the culture of its creators.
* Embodies specific limitations and features inherent to the technical resource, known as [Affordance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance).
* Exerts a subtle influence through conscious nudges.
* Shapes and impacts our thoughts and behaviors.

**_"Technologies are tools, not data. They are ways of relating, realizations of worldviews, processes in the making. They depend heavily on interactions, that is: all technologies embody, incorporate and tend to evolve and take to the extreme the ideologies of the people who created them."_**

* Dynamic, plural and changeable 
* Neither chaos nor order, written in a rigid schedule 
* Not done in solitude 

### What is a Convivial Technology? 

* It's situated: assume and declare its position in the world.
* It tends to a fair and equal distribution of shares.
* It's FREE as Free Software: everyone can modify and improve; it belongs to the lineage of freedom.
